## Project Overview

This is app created for coffee enthusiasts that helps to discover, browse, compare coffee beans.
Using web scraping techniques, I've integrated data from different online coffee shops,
providing users with a comprehensive selection of coffee beans, including details like origin, flavor profiles, new arrivals.
User can explore a wide range of coffee beans from various sources, all in one place.

## Setting Up Accounts on MongoDB and Firebase

To successfully run this project, you need to create accounts on MongoDB and Firebase. Here are the steps to follow:

### MongoDB

- Go to the MongoDB Atlas website and sign up for a new account.

- After signing up, create a new cluster. You can choose the free tier for development purpose.

- Set IP address to allow connections from everywhere.

- Create a new database user with a username and password. Note down the credentials as you will need them later to connect your application to MongoDB.

- In the server/.env file, update the MONGODB_URL variable with your MongoDB connection string. Replace <password> with the password of the database user you just created.

### Firebase

- Go to the Firebase console and sign up for a new account.

- Click on "Create a project". Give your project a name and click on "Continue".

- Follow the prompts to configure your project. You can leave the default settings for now.

- After creating the project, you will be redirected to the project dashboard. Click on "Develop" in the left sidebar and then on "Database".

- Choose "Start in test mode" and enable the "Enable Firestore" switch.

- Navigate to the "Project settings" by clicking on the gear icon next to "Project Overview" and select "Service accounts".

- Click on "Generate new private key". This will download a JSON file containing your Firebase Admin SDK credentials. Keep this file safe as it contains sensitive information.

- In the server/.env file, update the FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK variable with the content of the downloaded JSON file converted into a JSON string.

- Then client side, navigate to the Firebase console, click on "Project settings", then "Your apps", and select your app. In the "Firebase SDK snippet" section, select "Config". Copy the generated code and paste it into your client/.env file, replacing VITE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY, VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, and VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID with the corresponding values from the copied code.
